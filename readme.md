Weekend project to make long numbers eye scannable. [Use the app](https://chunkr.kierb.com/)

### Use-case

Whenever I purchase something online (from FB Page / Marketplace), I always have to squint my eyes to type their bank account number or gcash number.

This project chunks any number you paste and formats it into a eye scannable number
